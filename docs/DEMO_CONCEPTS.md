# Demo Concepts Documentation

This document describes the demo concept pipelines that demonstrate CI/CD concepts through simulated steps and echo outputs.

## 🎯 Overview

The demo concept pipelines are designed to showcase CI/CD concepts without requiring actual infrastructure or complex setup. They use simple `echo` commands to simulate real pipeline steps and demonstrate various DevOps practices.

## 📁 Demo Workflows

**Triggers**:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` branch
- Manual trigger with demo type selection

**Features**:
- ✅ **Simulated Docker Image Signing**: Demonstrates image signing concepts
- ✅ **Quality Checks**: Simulated linting, security, and coverage checks
- ✅ **Deployment Simulation**: Shows deployment to AWS ECS
- ✅ **Manual Triggers**: Different demo types (full, build-only, security-only, quality-only)
